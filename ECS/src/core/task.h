/** \brief implements independient portion of code, that is executed with some frequency
*
*   Tasks are usually called Systems in Entity-Component-System frameworks. I think Task is better name.
*
*   It is intended to operate on some component type. Example of Task may be PhysicsIntegrator, which gets
*   PhysicalBodyComponent and PositionComponent(by intersection, for example),
*   then calculates new position(PositionComponent) and velocity(PhysicalBodyComponent).
*
*   Another example might be Renderer, which gets PositionComponent and SpriteComponent,
*   and then displays sprite on screen at desired Position.
*
*   But Tasks are flexible, so you can use it to do any thing that should be done periodically.
*
*   By default, frequency will be once per game loop iteration(in config, task.defaultTaskFrequency).
